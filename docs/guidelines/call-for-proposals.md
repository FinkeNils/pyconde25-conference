# General Considerations

We would like to provide the following instructions in the CfP to clarify what we are looking for in the conference.

Content related:

 - topics of interest
 - submission types (30-minute talks, 3-hour workshop, etc.)
 - levels of expertise (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

Non-content related:

 - perks for accepted speakers (free ticket, etc.)
 - perks not to expected (no travel reimbursement, etc.) - _other conferences might offer this_
 - mentoring offers for first-time speakers
 - diversity and inclusion efforts (grants, etc.)
 - inclusion (e.g., childcare, accessibility)

## :fontawesome-solid-gavel: Policies

We discussed policies in the team before launching the CfP.
It's useful to have consistent policies settled beforehand, and we want to communicate them clearly to the submitters.

### Presentations Weighting

Based on participant stats and feedback, we are looking for a mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced topics.

| Level        | Description                                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| beginner     | New to the topic, basic understanding, needs step-by-step guidance      |
| intermediate | Regular user, familiar with common concepts, can solve typical problems |
| advanced     | Extensive experience, deep understanding, can handle complex scenarios  |


In 2024, the participants self-assessed as follows:

=== "Python Knowledge"

The following numbers are estimates and can be adjusted based on the submissions received.

| beginner     | 20%        | 
| intermediate | 45%        |
| advanced     | 35%        |

### Community Topics

Based on participant feedback, we want to make sure community topics are well represented and
we will work towards it with designated groups.

### Beginners

We want to work on dedicated formats for beginners
that offer a suitable environment for them to present and learn.    

### Intermediate & Advanced Topics

We would like to ask the speakers of intermediate and advanced topics to:

- outline prerequisites for attending their presentation
- focus the presentation on the main topic, excluding introductory material

### First-Time Speakers

We want to encourage first-time speakers to submit their proposals. 
We offer mentorship opportunities and will work with first time speakers to improve your submission if necessary.

### One Presentation per Speaker

We are interested in hearing from many voices. In the CfP, we accept one presentation per speaker only.

### Non-acceptance

We **do not accept** presentations that:

- can only be delivered remotely
- are part of a sales pitch

We likely **do not accept** presentations that:

- are available on video already or will be soon. Fresh content is preferred.


## :fontawesome-solid-handshake: Trust

We trust speakers to provide accurate information about their presentation. 
Submitting misleading or false information undermines our trust in the submission. :fontawesome-solid-handshake-slash:

think might be interested in contributing.

Our event brings together developers, data scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts from different fields to discuss a
wide range of topics. Talks cover various technical advancements, community development, and insights from practical
applications. The sessions are designed to cater to a broad audience, from beginners to experts, with a focus on sharing
knowledge, tools, and experiences.

### Conference Tracks & Topics of Interest

The conference will feature multiple tracks with around **100 talks** in total. You can submit your proposal under the
following tracks:

- **Community, Diversity & Inclusion**
- **Ethics, Privacy, and Career**
- **Infrastructure & Cloud**
- **Industry & Academia Use Cases**
- **Others (for topics that don't fit into the above categories)**

We encourage presentations on a variety of topics related to programming, software engineering, data science, machine
learning, and more. Our aim is to provide a diverse range of content that includes both technical and community-related
topics.

### Presentation Format

Presentations can be at: **novice, intermediate, or advanced levels**. Talks will have two possible lengths: either **30
or 45
minutes**. Hands-on **tutorials** will be **90 minutes** long. While attendees can join remotely, all presenters are
required to
deliver their sessions in person.

Accepted presentations will receive **one free conference ticket**. Additional speakers must purchase a ticket. While we
cannot cover travel expenses, we do offer a
diversity travel program and encourage speakers from diverse backgrounds to apply for funding.

### Submission Process

To submit your proposal, use the **Submit a proposal** button below. The conference committee will review all proposals
and provide feedback if needed. We especially encourage first-time speakers and will work with you to improve your
submission if necessary.

### Your Submission

Attendees typically pay close attention to the abstracts when deciding which talks to attend. Therefore, we recommend
writing a clear and concise abstract that reflects the value of your talk. Your abstract will be published in the
conference program as-is, though you may update it later.

Please ensure that your content is original and has not been presented at other conferences. We aim to offer our
attendees fresh and engaging ideas. Include key details such as:

- The problem your talk addresses.
- Why the problem is relevant to the audience.
- Your proposed solution.
- The main takeaways from your talk (for tutorials, clearly state what attendees will learn).

supporting diversity initiatives, there are **several sponsorship opportunities** available. Please reach out to us for

### Open Source

Our event is committed to the **open-source community**. We encourage presenters to share the code and tools discussed
in their talks. Ideally, the audience should have access to the necessary resources to reproduce your results. We also
encourage talks that focus on practical applications of tools and discourage product-focused sales pitches.

We ask all participants to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://example.com/code-of-conduct), ensuring a welcoming and
inclusive environment for everyone.
