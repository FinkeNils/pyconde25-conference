    This document is in part a work in progress.

!!! note
    Implementation is related to [infrastructure](infrastructure.md).

## Data and Volunteer Management

### Conference Data

As organizers, we handle significant amounts of sensitive information essential to our conference's operations:

- Speaker proposals and presentations
- Attendee registration details
- Financial transactions
- Communication records
- Volunteer information

We must manage this data professionally, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and maintaining the trust of our community.

### Volunteer Boundaries

Our volunteers are essential to the conference's success. We respect their commitment by:

- Maintaining clear boundaries between personal and conference activities
- Protecting their private contact information
- Enabling them to control their availability
- Implementing professional communication channels

Through proper infrastructure and clear policies, we ensure both data protection and volunteer well-being.

We trust people to act responsibly and professionally.  
We grant access to a need-to-know basis and expect volunteers to respect the privacy of others.

We want to be open to alternatives if they provide significant benefits.

## Tooling

We want to use as few tools as possible to avoid fragmentation and confusion.  
We want to use common tools that volunteers likely already know.

## Bad Practices and Solutions

Some bad practices we have identified and our solutions:

| **Topic**           | **Issue**                                                                       | **Solution**                                                                 |
