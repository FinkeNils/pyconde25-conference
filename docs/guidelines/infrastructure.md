## Tools for Collaboration

Starting with the 2025 conference, we implemented and will to evaluate the following setup

### Common Conference Google Workspace

- Group access control for all files and folders
- Group access for tools like Google Calendar, Meet, and Drive in a unified workspace
- Shared inboxes and distribution lists for conference communication
- Conference `@pycon.de` email addresses for all committee members

This way, it's straightforward to manage access control and ensure that all data is owned by the conference and not by individual volunteers.

### Trello for Task Management

- Each committee has a dedicated Trello board 
- All committee members can manage the committee board
- The board is visible to the committee members only by default but can be opened to other committees if needed, 
  **except** the Diversity Committee and Steering Committee boards might contain sensitive information and must be kept private
- The board is administered by the conference organization, it's not possible to create private boards


### Discord for Communication

We want to continue using Discord for communication, as it has proven to be a valuable tool for real-time communication and collaboration.

- Each committee has a dedicated channel
- All committee members can access the channel
- Other committees can access the channel, except: 
   - the Diversity Committee and Steering Committee channels, which might contain sensitive information and must be kept private

### Group Communication outside the Conference Committees

Messages sent to the committees or the conference from:
- conference attendees 
- speakers
- grant applicants

We use Google Groups for now (Nov 24).
After evaluation of Google Groups we decided to implement a helpdesk solution along with a mass email service via API.
