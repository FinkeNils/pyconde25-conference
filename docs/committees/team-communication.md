# Team Communication

Letâ€™s keep our committee channels focused on committee work so everyone stays informed and up to date. For casual
conversations or side chats, feel free to use private messagesâ€”thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re there for! ðŸ˜Š Keeping things organized
helps us work more efficiently and ensures no important details get lost. ðŸš€

## Inner-Committee Communication

We use Discord as our primary platform for internal communication. When you join, the Admins will invite you to your
committeeâ€™s channel to get started smoothly.

## Cross-Committee Communication

Each committee has its own dedicated Discord channel for internal discussions. For broader communication across
committees, we use the #all-committees channel. You can tag specific committees using @CommitteeName25 to ensure your
message reaches the right group.

## Channels and Access

To strike a balance between openness and data protection, most committee channels are open to all members of that
committee. However, some channels are restricted to safeguard sensitive, personal, or confidential information. These
restricted channels are only accessible to members of the relevant committee and the Steering Committee:

 * Steering Committee Channel: For overarching organizational matters.
 * Code of Conduct Channel: To ensure private discussions around community safety and well-being.
 * Diversity Committee Channel: For sensitive topics around inclusion and equity.
 * Program Committee Channel: For discussions involving confidential speaker or program-related matters.

### Why This Matters

Balancing transparency with the need for data protection helps us foster an open and collaborative environment while
respecting privacy and confidentiality where itâ€™s essential. This approach ensures that everyone feels secure and
informed while working together effectively.

## Feedback and Suggestions

Please feel free to share your feedback and suggestions for improvements  with the Steering Committee.
