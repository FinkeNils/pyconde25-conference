# PyCon DE & PyData Conference Playbook & Guidelines

This playbook is our public reference for how we run our volunteer-driven conference.
By sharing our experience we hope to help others to run their own conference.

We aim to update and refine this playbook continuously.
We always are motivated to share our knowledge and experience with others.

We are considerate in publishing guidelines and policies that could be misused and share them within the team (and
future teams) of our volunteer organisation in out protected workspace.
We act responsibly by not sharing confidential or private information,
